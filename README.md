# ibm-spacex-capstone

Overview

This repository contains the code notebooks and .csv data files  for the IBM Data Science Capstone Project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning classification model to predict if the first stage of future SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches will land, allowing us to predict their cost.

In this project, I downloaded launch data from the SpaceX API and scraped historical records from Wikipedia. After wrangling the data for exploratory analysis, I created a new landing outcome feature on which to develop and test classification models. I ran SQL queries, plots and maps to summarize the data and highlight relationships between the independent variables and landing outcomes. I preprocessed the data and tested four classication algorigthms (logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and K-neares neighbor) to see which model performed best on the train and test datasets. The project includes:

Data collection
Data wrangling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Modeling/Selection
